# Greeting Card Maker

Originally a HTML5 Canvas assignment for a "Graphics for the Web" college course. Expanded to be able to edit the canvas and create apology/greeting cards. This is mainly an educational project.

The canvas is sized to 550x412 pixels, which is the same as a 4:3 6x9 greeting card.
